# Cloudflare Pages Redirects Configuration
# Ensures React Router works properly (SPA routing)

# All routes should serve index.html for client-side routing
/*    /index.html   200

# This tells Cloudflare Pages to:
# 1. Try to serve the requested file first
# 2. If not found, serve index.html instead
# 3. Return 200 status (not 404) so React Router can handle it
